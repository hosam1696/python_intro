- You have learned the basics of Python and you love the language because it's friendly and pragmatic.
Now you want to become a productive Python programmer who can develop efficient, elegant code in an efficient, agile manner.
This course is for you. My name is Michele Vallisneri and I will show you how to cut down on your development time by writing more expressive and concise Python code
and by using the most powerful features of the language. In this course I will discuss how you can select and take advantage of the strongest third party packages.
I will introduce you to object oriented and functional programming which you will need to take your coding skills to the next level.
I'll recommend the best strategies to improve the performance of your code.
We will do all of this while working through examples that highlight just how much you can achieve with a few lines of Python.
