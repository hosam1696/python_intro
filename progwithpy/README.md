# Introduction with Python

learn about python, one of the most widely used programming languages in **AI**

you will learn why is python is unique and understand the data types and operators it handles

you will learn how to use a pre-tained classifier to write a script that identifies dog breeds


---

**Jupyter Notebooks** (create documents combining code text, images), **Anaconda** (environment manager built specifically for data), **Numpy** (add support for large data)
**Pandas** (used for data manipulation) and **Mapplotlib** (used for data visualization)


* Linear Algerbra Essentials

Learn the basics of the beautiful visual world of Linear Algebra and why it is such an important mathematical tool in the world of AI. You will learn about vectors, matrices, linear combinations and linear transformations. We will also combine your new programming skills with visual linear algebra labs


Neural Networks: Acquire a solid foundation in deep learning and neural networks. Here you will learn about techniques for how to improve the training of a neural network and how to use PyTorch for building deep learning models.

### pytorch
open source machine learning



you will beable to use its built functions as well as write your own functions to encapsulate a series of commands
